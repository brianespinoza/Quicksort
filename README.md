# Quicksort

While R has it's very "own" sorting function, the quicksort algorithm comes up a lot in many data structure scenarios. Given that R was built with data in mind, I was surprised to find very few examples of it here on GitHub. As of today, May 17 2016, this is only one of 2 R implementations of the Quicksort function posted on this site. I've created this to be used as a learning tool for myself and for anyone who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of data sorting in R. I've also included a plot showing the elapsed time as elements grow by an order of 10. Anyone and everyone is welcome to freely use and implement this function as is, all I ask is that you contact me so I know what cool projects this is going to! In the future, I will play around with setting the pivot point but I believe that this should suffice for now.

Happy sorting!
